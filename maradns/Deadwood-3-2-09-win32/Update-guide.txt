Deadwood 3.2.09 is a bugfix-only upgrade of Deadwood 3.2.08.  No changes 
made impact install.

---

Deadwood 3.2.08 has increased the maximum number of queries at the
same time from 32 to 1024.  If the old behavior is desired, add this
to one's dwood3rc file:

maxprocs=32

The maximum value is now 8388608.

---

Deadwood 3.2.07 is a bugfix-only upgrade of Deadwood 3.2.06.  No changes 
made impact install.

---

Deadwood 3.2.06 is a bugfix-only upgrade of Deadwood 3.2.05.  No changes 
made impact install.

---

Deadwood 3.2.05 is a security and stability update.  If not set, the
default value of random_seed_file is, in Windows, now "secret.txt"
instead of "/dev/urandom"; this will not affect users who use the
value of random_seed_value set in dwood3rc.txt

Users of older Deadwood (pre-3.2.04) releases who set root_servers in 
their Deadwood configuration file need to change the IP for one of 
the root servers from 128.8.10.90 to 199.7.91.13.

---

Deadwood 3.2.04 is Deadwood with all Deadwood 3.2.03[a-d] updates
and other bug fixes.  Should there be over 20,000 root_servers or
upstream_servers entries, Deadwood will not exit with a fatal error,
which is better than its old behavior of running but not working.

---

Deadwood 3.2.03d is Deadwood 3.2.03c with a 10-line bugfix patch.  No
changes impact install.

---

Deadwood 3.2.03c is Deadwood 3.2.03a with a 7-line bugfix patch.  No
changes impact install.

---

Deadwood 3.2.03a is a one-line bugfix relative to Deadwood 3.2.03.  No
changes impact install.

---

Deadwood 3.2.03 is a stable release.  Since having a cache file that is
newer than the dwood3rc.txt file can cause Deadwood to show unusual 
error messages, Deadwood no longer uses the cache file if it's older
than dwood3rc.txt.

---

Deadwood 3.2.02 is a stable release.  This release has a new parameter:
max_ttl, which limits how long an entry can stay in the cache; the default
TTL cap is one day (86400 seconds).  

---

Deadwood 3.2.01 is a stable release.  The default timeout has been decreased
from 2 to 1 second.  This will make resolution faster for the majority of
users; for users on slow connections with problems resolving domains,
add the following line to a dwood3rc file:

timeout_seconds = 3

num_retries now has a default value of 5 instead of 2.  To restore the
old value, add this to the dwood3rc file:

num_retries = 2

---

Deadwood 3.0.04, in addition to fixing a number of bugs, has added some
features.  In particular:

  * I consider it a bug if any valid dwood3rc file does not parse in Python 2.
    That in mind, I have updated the dwood3rc parser to not allow parameters to
    have any leading whitespace (since whitespace is significant in Python).

    This is OK:

recursive_acl = "127.0.0.1/16, 192.168.1.1/24"

    But this will raise an error:

  recursive_acl = "127.0.0.1/16, 192.168.1.1/24"

    (Observe the extra space in the left of the second example)

  * It is no longer allowed to set both root_servers or upstream_servers for a
    given name. In other words, a configuration like this will now raise an
    error:

upstream_servers = {}
upstream_servers["example.com."] = "127.0.0.1"
root_servers = {}
root_servers["example.com."] = "192.168.1.1"

  * Deadwood now raises a warning when the same name is set more than once.
    This will now trigger a warning:

upstream_servers = {}
upstream_servers["example.net."] = "10.1.2.3"
upstream_servers["example.net."] = "192.168.1.1"

    I was tempted to make this fatal, but decided not to because making this
    fatal would make it more difficult to manage large anti-phish/malware
    blacklists.

  * It is no longer permitted to initialize root_servers or upstream_servers
    more than once. This will now raise an error:

upstream_servers = {}
upstream_servers["example.net."] = "10.1.2.3"
upstream_servers = {}
upstream_servers["example.com."] = "192.168.1.1"

  * Deadwood will now raise an error for invalid lists of root or upstream
    servers. This is now fatal:

root_servers = {}
root_servers["."] = "foo"

  * Deadwood now requires that any bind_address is in the recursive ACL.  
    This is now fatal:

bind_address = "127.0.0.1, 192.168.1.42"
recursive_acl = "127.0.0.1/16"

    It can be fixed thusly:

bind_address = "127.0.0.1, 192.168.1.42"
recursive_acl = "127.0.0.1/16, 192.168.1.1/24"

Deadwood 3.0.03 is a bugfix-only upgrade of Deadwood 3.0.02.  No changes made
will impact users.

---

Deadwood 3.0.02 is a bugfix-only upgrade of Deadwood 3.0.01.  

The one update that will noticably impact users is the fact that
filter_rfc1918 now filters more DNS replies.  In particular, DNS
answers with the following IP ranges are now filtered by default:

     * 192.168.x.x
     * 172.[16-31].x.x
     * 10.x.x.x
     * 127.x.x.x
     * 169.254.x.x
     * 224.x.x.x
     * 0.0.x.x

If one of the above IPs is detected in a DNS reply, and filter_rfc1918
has a value of 1, Deadwood will return a synthetic "this host does not
reply" response (a SOA record in the NS section) instead of the A record.

The reason for this is to provide a "dnswall" that protects users for
some kinds of attacks, as described at http://crypto.stanford.edu/dns/

If it is desired to have DNS answers with these IPs, add the following
line to dwood3rc.txt:

filter_rfc1918 = 0
